## Topics

### Definition

- used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of
  information in an organization.
- involves people, processes and technology in an organizational context.
- In a corporate setting, the ultimate goal of the use of a MIS is to increase the value and profits
  of the business.
- This is done by providing managers with timely and appropriate information allowing them to make
  effective decisions within a shorter period of time.

### Components

Same as IS

### Characteristics

Same as IS

### Pitfalls in MIS development

#### Poor Existing Management System

Even excellent MIS cannot make up poor management system. In fact, the existing management
systems are the base for Developing MIS. Whatever Shortcomings are associated with the basic
management system; the same shortcomings can be expected in the developed MIS.

#### Inadequate Resources

Due to poor management, an MIS project may be starved of resources. For successful completion
of the project, the outlays should be provided separately and once allocated for development of
MIS, funds should not be diverted to another users

#### No misson statement

Not having the crispy stated mission and purpose for the company is a common weakness.
Since if it is not terrible clear what business we are in, each major challenge the
company must face is a completely new challenge and must be analyzed from the ground up. If
there was a mission statement, some of these problems could be dealt with routinely as opposed to
their being major crises.

#### Poor management of information

The information is the raw material of decision-making for MIS, and if information is not being
generated, disseminated, and used for management, then no system-manual or computer is going to
solve organisational problems.

#### Communication Gap

In MIS, user express information needs and the designer designs the flow chart and graphs
according to the user requirements. After designing, the programmer incorporates his own ideas
and interpretations, for developing the system. In these development stages, one undefined
requirement can develop an incorrect information system.

### Implementation of MIS

- process of placing a newly developed MIS into operation

#### Planning for Implementation

- identifying various activities, their sequence, and time required for each activity
- Gantt Charts and Network Diagrams are used for planning

#### Acquisition of Facilities and Space Planning

- office, computer room and computer library are required.
- includes estimating the space occupied by computers and its various peripherals such as
  terminals,printers, workers, etc

#### MIS Organisation and Procedure Development

- recruit other human resources
- developing procedures for various other activities
  - e.g. evaluating and selecting hardware and buying or developing required software

#### User Training

- users should be trained according to their requirement
- clerical users: processing and functioning of MIS
- manager: on-line inquiries

#### Acquisition of Hardware and Software

- Start acquiring hardware and software needed of MIS

#### Creation of Forms and Database

- Database is used to store data, and forms are used for transmitting data
- Forms are used to input data to MIS and receive the output data from the MIS

#### Testing

- performed to find out whether or not each and every element of MIS such as equipments,
  programs and forms, are working according to their design specifications

- also calculates accuracy, range of inputs, frequency of inputs, operating conditions
  and reliability factors of the MIS.

- CASE tools are used

#### Change Over

- **Direct:** uninstall or remove the existing MIS and install the newly developed MIS in place
  of the old one
- **Parallel:** installs the newly developed MIS in parallel with the existing MIS until the new
  MIS is not tested properly
- **Modular:** , the user's workstation is divided into groups and the new MIS is installed for
  each group.
- **Phase-in:** each MIS segment in installed at the users workstation and performs a specific
  function.

### Evaluatin of MIS

- a process in which the performance of an organisational MIS is determined

#### Evaluation Classes

To evaluate the performance of MIS, the following two classes are used:

- Effectiveness
- Efficiency

The relationship between effectiveness and efficiency can be defined as
effectiveness is a measure of quality of an MIS output, while efficiency is a measure
of the resources required to achieve the output

#### Evaluation Approaches

##### Quality Assurance Review

- also known as technical review determines the technical quality performance of MIS.
- i.e data transmission rate, main or secondary storage and CPU capacity
- performed by development personnel or a quality assurance group

##### Compliance Audits

- also known as application control review
- It determines the adequacy and completeness of MIS controls for the system inputs,
  outputs and security, etc
- A specific internal audit function is used to perform the compliance audit.

##### MIS Personnel Productivity Measurement

- determines the capacity of MIS personnel
- evaluated in terms of productivity
- LOC per unit time determine the capacity of the programming personnel.

##### Computer Performance Evaluation

- determines the production capacity of computer hardware
- calculated in terms of performance efficiencies and bottlenecks such as actual throughput
  and I/O channel utilisation, which limits the production.

##### User Attitude Survey

- determines the operational consideration evaluation
- whether or not the input data is adequately provided to MIS and the output is usable.

##### Cost/Benefit Analysis

- economic evaluation
- It determines the MIS effect on the organisational performance in terms of money
- calculate ROI
