### Components

Same as IS

### Characteristics

Same as IS

### Pitfalls in MIS development

#### Poor Existing Management System

Even excellent MIS cannot make up poor management system. In fact, the existing management
systems are the base for Developing MIS. Whatever Shortcomings are associated with the basic
management system; the same shortcomings can be expected in the developed MIS.

#### Inadequate Resources

Due to poor management, an MIS project may be starved of resources. For successful completion
of the project, the outlays should be provided separately and once allocated for development of
MIS, funds should not be diverted to another users

#### No misson statement

Not having the crispy stated mission and purpose for the company is a common weakness.
Since if it is not terrible clear what business we are in, each major challenge the
company must face is a completely new challenge and must be analyzed from the ground up. If
there was a mission statement, some of these problems could be dealt with routinely as opposed to
their being major crises.

#### Poor management of information

The information is the raw material of decision-making for MIS, and if information is not being
generated, disseminated, and used for management, then no system-manual or computer is going to
solve organisational problems.

#### Communication Gap

In MIS, user express information needs and the designer designs the flow chart and graphs
according to the user requirements. After designing, the programmer incorporates his own ideas
and interpretations, for developing the system. In these development stages, one undefined
requirement can develop an incorrect information system.
