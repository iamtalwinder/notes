### Simon’s Model of Decision-Making

His model of decision-making has three phase:

- **Intelligence phase** deals with the problem identification and the data collection on the problem.
- **Design phase** deals with the generation of alternative solutions to the problem at hand.
- **Choice phase** deals with selecting the ‘best’ solution from amongst the alternative solutions using some criterion

#### Intelligence Phase

- It is first step towards the decision-making process.
- A decision-maker studies the environment and identifies the problem or opportunity.
  The scanning of environment may be continuous or intermittent. For example,

  - Reviewing of daily scrap report by a production manager to check the problems related
    to quality control. This is an example for continuous scanning.

  - Periodic visiting of a sales executive to the key customers to review possible problems
    and to identify new customer needs. This is an example for intermittent scanning.

- A problem in the managerial context is detecting anything that is not according to the plan,
  rule or standard
- **Example:** sales manager detects a sudden drop in sales
- Opportunity is the identification of a promising circumstance that might lead to better results.
- **Example:** a marketing manager gets to know that two of his competitors will shut down operations
  for some reason in the next three months, this means that he will be able to sell more in the market.

- This phase involves:

  - **Problem searching**

    - Refers to the difference between the expected and real result obtained after making a decision,
      which is given by the following formula:
      ```
      (Desired/Expected) – (Actual/Reality) = Difference/Problem
      ```
    - **Example:** a sales manager sets a sales target of five lakhs in a particular month, but he only
      achieved four lack in sales. Therefore, difference (one lack) is the problem.

    - In actual practice, the reality or actual value is compared to some standard desired model.

  - **Problem formulation**

    - Refers to the proper identification of the problem to avoid the risk of solving the wrong problem.
    - To avoid such a risk, it is very important to understand the problem well and state it clearly
    - Sometimes, the process of clearly defining the problem is sufficient; but in other cases, we
      have to simplify the problem by determining its boundaries. Boundaries are simplified by breaking
      the problem into smaller manageable sub-problems.
    - Establishing relations with some problems that are solved earlier prove quite useful.

#### Design phase

Includes inventing or developing various alternatives in order to get the best possible alternative.
It is a timeconsuming and crucial activity, as the decision-maker has to explore all the possible alternatives. Decision-maker should not take the risk of missing any alternative since the missed-out alternative might be the best one from the given alternatives. Developing alternatives is a creative activity, which can be enhanced by various aids such as brainstorming, checklists and analogies.

#### Choice phase

Refers to the selection of an alternative developed in the design phase as the decision by the decision-maker. A decision-maker makes a detailed analysis of each and every alternative for performing this selection. After making a decision, the decision is implemented. However, at any phase, the decision-maker may return to the previous phase. For example, the decision-maker in the choice phase may reject all alternatives and return to the design phase for developing more alternatives.
