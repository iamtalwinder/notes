  these objectives, resources used to obtain these objectives and the policies that are used in the
  acquisition, use and disposition of these resources.
- Its activities are performed by top management.
- It helps the organisationto forsee its future in the long run and thus helps the management to
  take steps accordingly.

  policies formulated by the top management.

  effectively and efficiently in order to achieve the organisational goals.

  operations to avoid any wastage of resources and helps in utilising the resources efficiently
