### Definition

A system is an orderly grouping of inter-dependent components linked together according to a plan to
achieve a specific objective.

Components:

- physical part(engine, keyboard, wings of air craft etcetera).

- marginal part(planning, organizing, and controlling).

A component can be simple or complex, basic or advance. In either case, each component is part
of total system and has to do its fair share of work for the system to achieve the intended results.

The study of systems concepts has three basic implications:

1. A system must be design to achieve a pre-determined objective.

2. Inter-relationships and inter-dependence must exist between components.

3. The objective of a system as a whole has a higher priority than its sub-systems.

### Characteristics

#### Organization

- Means structure and order.

- Examples:

  - Business system: hierarchical organization in a company.

  - Computer system: organization of different components like input devices, output devices, CPU,
    and storage devices.

#### Interaction

- Manner in which each component or sub-system functions with other components.

- Examples:

  - CPU interacts with input devices to get data needed for processing.

  - The main memory holds the data and the programs that ALU uses for computation.

#### Inter-dependence

- Means parts depend on one another.

- All are connected together according to a plan.

- Output of one sub-system is input of another.

- Example:
  A decision to computerize an application is initiated by the user, analyzed and designed by the
  analyst, programmed and tested by the programmer, and run by the computer operator.

#### Integration

- How sub-systems are tied together to achieve the system objective.

- It means that parts of the system work together within the system even though each part performs
  a unique function.

#### Central objective

- Objectives may be real or stated.

- Although a stated objective may be the real objective, it is not uncommon for an organization to
  state one objective and operate to achieve another.

- The users must know the main objective of a computer application early in the analysis for a
  successful design and conversion.

- Real objective vs stated objective:

  A stated goal is what the company states to the public as the official mission while the real
  goals are the actual targets that the company works on throughout the year.

### Elements

#### Outputs and Inputs

<br />
<p align="center">

</p>
<br />

- The main aim of a system is to produce a good output which is useful for its user.

- Inputs are the information that enters into the system for processing.

- Output is outcome of the processing.

- Output is a first step in specifying the nature, amount, and regularity of the input needed to
  operate a system.

#### Processor(s)

- It involves the actual transformation of input into output.

- It may modify the input totally or partially, depending on the output specifications.

- As the output specifications change so does the processing. In some cases, input is also modified
  to enable the processor to handle the transformation.

#### Control

- The control element guides the system.

- It is the decision – making subsystem that controls the pattern of activities governing
  input, processing, and output.

- Examples:

  - Business system: management as a decision – making body controls the inflow, handling
    and outflow of activities that affect the welfare of the business.

  - Computer system: the operating system and accompanying software influence the behavior
    of the computer.

#### Feedback

- Feedback provides the control in a dynamic system.

- Output is compared against performance standards to produce feedback.

- Two Types:

  - Positive: reinforces the performance of the system.

  - Negative: generally provides the controller with information for action.

#### Environment

- The environment is the “supersystem” within which an organization operates.

- It is the source of external elements that strike on the system.

- It often determines how a system must function.

- Example:

  Business system: the organization’s environment, consisting of vendors, competitors, and
  others, may provide constraints and, consequently, influence the actual performance of the
  business.

#### Boundaries and Interface

- Each system has boundaries that determine its sphere of influence and control.

- A system should be defined by its boundaries – the limits that identify its components,
  processes and inter-relationship when it interfaces with another system.

- Example:

  A teller system in a commercial bank is restricted to the deposits, withdrawals and related
  activities, it may exclude mortgage foreclosures, trust activities, and the like.

- Importance:

  - Knowledge of the boundaries is crucial in determining the nature of its interface with
    other systems for successful design.

  - Example:

    A customer who has a mortgage and a checking account with the same bank may write a check through the “teller system” which needs to be processed through “mortgage loan system.”
