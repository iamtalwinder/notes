## Topics

### Definition

Information systems are combinations of hardware, software, and telecommunications networks
that people build and use to collect, create, and distribute useful data, typically in
organizational settings.

### Components

#### Hardware

Information systems hardware is the part of an information system you can touch – the physical
components of the technology. Computers, keyboards, disk drives, iPads, and flash drives are all
examples of information systems hardware.

#### Software

Software is a set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Software is not tangible –
it cannot be touched. There are several categories of software, with the two main categories being
operating-system software, which makes the hardware usable, and application software, which does
something useful.

#### Data

The third component is data. You can think of data as a collection of facts. For example, your
street address, the city you live in, and your phone number are all pieces of data. Like software,
data is also intangible. By themselves, pieces of data are not really very useful. But aggregated,
indexed, and organized together into a database, data can become a powerful tool for businesses.

#### People

People are involved in information systems in just about every way you can think of: people imagine
information systems, people develop information systems, people support information systems, and,
perhaps most importantly, people use information systems.

#### Process

The last component of information systems is process. A process is a series of steps undertaken to
achieve a desired outcome or goal. Information systems are becoming more and more integrated with
organizational processes, bringing more productivity and better control to those processes.

### Characteristics

#### Accurate

Information must be free from errors and mistakes.

#### Complete

All the information needed to make a good decision must be available. Nothing should be missing.

#### Cost Effective

The cost of obtaining information must not exceed the benefit of the information in monetary terms

#### User-focused

The information must be presented in such a way that it should address the information requirements
of the target user.

#### Relevant

The information must be relevant to the recipient. The information must be directly related to the
problem that the intended recipient is facing.

#### Authoritative

The information must come from a reliable source.

#### Timely

Information should be available when it is needed.

### Types

#### Management information system (MIS)

- used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of
  information in an organization.
- involves people, processes and technology in an organizational context.
- In a corporate setting, the ultimate goal of the use of a MIS is to increase the value and profits
  of the business.
- This is done by providing managers with timely and appropriate information allowing them to make
  effective decisions within a shorter period of time.

#### Executive information system (EIS)

- also known as an Executive Support System (ESS).
- is a type of management support system that facilitates and supports senior executive.
  information and decision-making needs.
- is tailored to the unique information needs of executives who plan for the business and
  assess performance against those plans.
- provides easy access to internal and external information relevant to organizational goals.
- commonly considered a specialized form of decision support system (DSS).
- emphasizes graphical displays and easy-to-use user interfaces.

#### Decision support system (DSS)

- tends to be aimed at the less well structured, underspecified problem that upper level
  managers typically face.
- attempts to combine the use of models or analytic techniques with traditional data access
  and retrieval functions.
- specifically focuses on features which make them easy to use by non-computer-proficient
  people in an interactive mode
- emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to accommodate changes in the environment and the
  decision making approach of the user.

#### Transaction processing system (TPS)

- Transaction processing is a manner of processing where it divides tasks/work into smaller
  operations which are known as transactions
- A Transaction processing system is a combination of certain hardware and software components
  which are able to support transaction processing
- Types:
  - **Batch processing:** transactions are gathered and processed at a certain time or when it meets
    certain criteria to be processed.
  - **Real-Time:** transactions are process immediately when they are received
- Benefits:
  - It does not require human interference it is an automated process.
  - These systems have very good performance and response time.

### Electronic Data Processing (EDP)

- processing of data using electronic means such as computers, calculators, servers and
  other similar electronic equipment.
- it is fast, accurate, reliable and flexible
- used by all companies dealing with real time data processing e.g, ecommerce industry,
  banking services, and record keeping etc.
- **stages:** collection --> preparation --> input --> processing --> storage.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduce cost.
  - Increase efficiency.
  - Improves internal and external collaboration.
  - Increase data security.
  - Reduce error.
  - Reduce the duplication of effort i:e repeated entries.
  - Better error handling.

### Office Automation Systems (OAS)

- computer-based information system that collects, processes, stores and
  transmits electronic messages, documents and other forms of communication among
  individuals, work groups and organizations.
- combination of different types technologies such as word processors, spreadsheets,
  electronic mail, and so on.
- aim is to improve efficiency and productivity of employees.
