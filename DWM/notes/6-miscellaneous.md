## Topics

#### Artificial intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that
are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to
any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and
problem-solving.

Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong.

- **Weak artificial intelligence** embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job.
  Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants
  such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.

  **Strong artificial intelligence** systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be
  human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene.
  These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating
  rooms

#### Importance of AI

- AI technology is important because it enables human capabilities – understanding, reasoning,
  planning, communication and perception – to be undertaken by software increasingly effectively, efficiently and at low cost.

- General analytical tasks, including finding patterns in data, that have been performed by software
  for many years can also be performed more effectively using AI.

- The automation of these abilities creates new opportunities in most business sectors and
  consumer applications.

- Significant new products, services and capabilities enabled by AI include autonomous vehicles,
  automated medical diagnosis, voice input for human-computer interaction, intelligent agents,
  automated data synthesis and enhanced decision-making.
