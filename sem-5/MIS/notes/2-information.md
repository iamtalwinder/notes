#### Strategic Information

- This information is required by topmost management for long range planning policies for next
  few years.
- For example, trends in revenues, financial investment, and human resources, and
  population growth.
- Achieved with the aid of Decision Support System (DSS).

#### Managerial Information

- This type of Information is required by middle management for short and intermediate range
  planning which is in terms of months.
- For example, sales analysis, cash flow projection, and annual financial statements.
- Achieved with the aid of Management Information Systems (MIS).

#### Operational Information

- This type of information is required by low management for daily and short term planning to enforce
  day-to-day operational activities.
- For example, keeping employee attendance records, overdue purchase orders, and current stocks available.
- Achieved with the aid of Data Processing Systems (DPS).

### Role of Information in decision making

Information plays a vital role in decision-making. Even to take very simple decisions, we need
information.

To understand the role played by information in decision-making, we have to understand
how decisions are taken.

Imagine a simple decision like the one a driver (say) makes when he puts on the brakes to stop a
speeding vehicle when he sees a child crossing the road (in middle of the road). The driver decides
on braking based on a lot of information processing that happens in his brain.

**Breaking down stages of decision making:**

1. **Identification and structuring of problem**

   One needs information to identify a problem and put it in a structured manner. Without
   information about the problem, the decision-making process does not even start.

   In our example, if the driver didn't see the child, the decision-making process of braking
   the car wouldn't have begun.

2. **Putting the problem in context**

   Without information about the context in which the problem has occurred, one cannot take
   any decision on it. In a way, the information about the context defines the problem.

   In our example, if the driver was far away from the child, he/she might've slowed down the
   car instead.

3. **Generation of alternatives**

   Information is a key ingredient in the generation of alternatives for decision-making. One has
   to have information about possible solutions to generate alternatives.

   In our example alternative would've been:

   - to stop by braking
   - to slow down
   - to take a sharp turn towards left or right to avoid the child
   - press the horn so that the child crosses the road fast
   - To drive the vehicle on to the footpath and out of the road to avoid collision, etc.

4. **Choice of best alternative**

   Based on the information about the suitability of the alternatives, a choice is made to select the
   best alternative.

   In our example, the driver stopped the car.
