## Topics

### Definition

- It is used for predicting the outcome of unknown samples
- It is used for categorization of objects (or things) into given discrete number of classes
- Classification problems can be of two types, either binary or multiclass
- binary: only have two possible values e.g. a team will either win or lose
- multiclass: attribute can have more than two values e.g. the sentiment of a sentence can be
  happy, sad, angry or of love
- Usage:
  - To analyze the credit history of bank customers to identify if it would be risky or safe to
    grant them loans.
  - To analyze the purchase history of a shopping mallâ€™s customers to predict whether they
    will buy a certain product or not.
